# ðŸ”§ QUICK FIX SOLUTION FOR INTERFACE JUMPING

The interface is jumping between versions because of process conflicts. Here's how to fix it:

## Step 1: Force Kill All Processes

```bash
sudo pkill -f gunicorn
sudo systemctl stop ml-extractor.service  
```

## Step 2: Copy Updated Files

```bash
cp "/home/granaventura/Desktop/ML EXTRACTOR/passenger_wsgi.py" "/home/granaventura/app_ml_extractor/"
cp "/home/granaventura/Desktop/ML EXTRACTOR/app_improved.py" "/home/granaventura/app_ml_extractor/"
cp "/home/granaventura/Desktop/ML EXTRACTOR/auth_system.py" "/home/granaventura/app_ml_extractor/"
```

## Step 3: Set Environment Variable

```bash
echo "USE_IMPROVED=1" > /home/granaventura/app_ml_extractor/.env
```

## Step 4: Restart Service

```bash
sudo systemctl start ml-extractor.service
```

## Step 5: Test

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000 | head -20
```

## Alternative: Use Simple Interface

If you prefer the stable simple interface without jumping:

```bash
echo "USE_IMPROVED=0" > /home/granaventura/app_ml_extractor/.env
sudo systemctl restart ml-extractor.service
```

## Root Cause

The jumping happens because:

1. Multiple app versions in memory
2. Passenger WSGI switching between apps  
3. Caching issues with gunicorn workers

## Solution Implemented

- Updated passenger_wsgi.py with proper app selection
- Clear environment variable control
- Force restart to clear memory
